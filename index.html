      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p> My name is Kimberly. I'm a college student, wife, mother, and lover of all things creative!</p>
      <p>I'm currently a student at Southwestern College where I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Programming Technology. 
        I have just 6 courses remaining and am expected to graduate December 2021! I was led to the computer programming field after 
        spending nearly 10 years working in Technical and Adult Education. During that time I became familiar with various database
        systems and began learning as much as I possible about how they work.</p>    
      <p>I've been married for nearly 13 years to my wonderful husband, James. We have two amazing children, 9-year old Aiden and 
        1-year old Jonah. They are smart, funny, and definitely keep me on my toes. In my spare time (that is still a thing, right?) 
        I have plenty of hobbies to keep myself busy. My favorites are those that allow me to be creative for myself. But I also 
        appreciate the beauty in nature as well as the creations of others.</p>
