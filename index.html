    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p> My name is Kimberly. I'm a college student, wife, mother, and lover of all things
     creative!</p>
    <p>I'm currently a student at Southwestern College where I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in  
      Computer Programming Technology. I have just 6 courses remaining and am expected to graduate  
      December 2021! I was led to the computer programming field after spending nearly 10 years working
      in Technical and Adult Education. During that time I became familiar with various database
      systems and began learning as much as I possible about how they work.</p>    
    <p>I've been married for nearly 13 years to my wonderful husband, James. We have two amazing children, 
      9-year old Aiden and 1-year old Jonah. They are smart, funny, and definitely keep me on my toes. 
      In my spare time (that is still a thing, right?) I have plenty of hobbies to keep myself busy. My     
      favorites are those that allow me to be creative for myself. But I also appreciate the beauty in nature as
      well as the creations of others.</p>
